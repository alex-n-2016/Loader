Before testing the bot utility (located in directory ./bin/) you need
1) start RabbitMQ server
2) correct the property file located in directory ./common/src/resources
   (which is used for setting dropbox storage connection parameters and path to temp dir)
3) build maven project
4) set JAVA_HOME environment variable
